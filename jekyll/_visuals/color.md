Firefox colors are bold, vibrant and attractive. They enhance the experience by providing visual clues and by bringing attention to primary actions.

## Palettes

The color palette includes primary and secondary colors that can be used for interfaces and illustrations.

### Blue

Firefox Blue is one of our primary colors. We use blue as accent color for highlighting buttons, links, and active states like the active tab in Firefox default theme.

{% include color/blue.md %}

### Teal

Firefox Teal is one of our primary colors. We use teal as an attention color.

{% include color/teal.md %}

### Magenta

Firefox Magenta is one of our primary colors. We currently have no common usage for it.

{% include color/magenta.md %}

### Green

Firefox Green is commonly used to indicate success.

{% include color/green.md %}

### Yellow

{% include color/yellow.md %}

### Red

{% include color/red.md %}

### Purple

### Ink

Firefox Ink is commonly used for interfaces (e.g., Firefox tab strip on Windows 10 default theme).

{% include color/ink.md %}

### Grey

  Firefox Grey is commonly used for interfaces (e.g., Firefox light theme).

### White

We use white for the background of doorhangers or in-content menus.

### DevTools Exclusive Additions

The complex interface of DevTools has yielded an expansion to the standard Photon color chart.   
These Photon colors should **only** be used in exceptional circumstances when standard photon colors do not provide a sufficient color range or contrast in DevTools interfaces.

**These reserve colors should not be used in any other scenario.**

## Accessibility

### Color Contrast

Follow the [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#visual-audio-contrast) Level AA guidelines to ensure proper color contrast.


#### Color Contrast Values

* **Fail** – Your text doesn't have enough contrast with the background.

* **AA Large** – Acceptable contrast for type sizes >= 18px.

* **AA** – Acceptable contrast for text sizes below 18px.

* **AAA** – Enhanced contrast.

### Color Blind

There are different types of color blindness. The most common form is red-green color blindness, followed by blue-yellow color blindness and total color blindness. Red-green color blindness affects up to 8% of males and 0.5% of females. Ensure that adjacent color shades are distinguishable for color blind people. Use a color blindness analyzer to confirm your choices.

### High Contrast on Windows

Windows currently offers multiple high contrast modes. Ensure that colors are translated properly, following the hierarchy defined for the default theme.
